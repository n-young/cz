Hello! I'm Christine Zhou, a sophomore studying Mechanical Engineering and Visual Art at Brown University.

I'm constantly trying to combine engineering and art in the way I think and the way I work. I've built height-adjustable lamps in the workshop, designed a kinetic sculpture that uses cam theory to produce wave motions, and dreamt up solutions to coronavirus-induced issues.

In my free time, I love wandering through museums, snapping Instagram pictures of my friends, and playing the app 1010! (which looks deceptively easy).
