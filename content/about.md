Hello! I'm Christine Zhou, a junior studying Mechanical Engineering and Visual Art at Brown University.

I practice human-centered design in my work and am constantly thinking of how art, engineering, and humans go together. My engineering background keeps my projects grounded, providing me with a sense of what's durable, cost-effective, and manufacturable while my art background feeds me grand ideas.

In my free time, I love driving aimlessly, wandering through museums, and collecting Chipotle points.
