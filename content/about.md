Hello! I'm Christine Zhou, a rising junior studying Mechanical Engineering and Visual Art at Brown University.

I practice human-centered design on my personal projects and am constantly thinking of how art, engineering, and humans go together. I love using my hands in the workshop -- operating machines ranging from 3D printers to bandsaws to plasma welders -- but also sitting down to make sketches and CAD models. My engineering background helps keep my projects grounded, providing me with a sense of what's durable, cost-effective, and manufacturable while my art background feeds me grand ideas.

In my free time, I love wandering through museums, watching awe-inspiring Studio Ghibli films, and playing the app 1010! (which looks deceptively easy).

Reach out if you'd like to learn more!
