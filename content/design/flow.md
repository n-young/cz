# Flow

Flow is a kinetic sculpture inspired by the works of Arthur Ganson.

With the idea of an underwater shadow projector in mind, I began to design my first kinetic mechanism. A teaching assistant walked by and asked if I was designing a cam. I had no idea what cams were at the time, and yet I was sketching one in my notebook. I began researching cams, refining my idea by using cam theories.

## Deliverables

1) Generate an oscillating, wave-like motion, mimicking underwater movements.

2) Use woodworking and metalworking techniques in the construction of the project.
