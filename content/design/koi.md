# Koi Fish Lantern

The koi fish lantern was my first project in which I incorporated engineering in an art class (Sculpture: Conceptual Propositions). This project was open-ended, with the only specification being to design and build a lantern using a combination of woodworking and metalworking techniques.












## Deliverables

1) Design a height-adjustable lantern.

2) Confirm that the beam elements would not buckle under weight.




## Process

1) Draft a design for a height-adjustable lamp inspired by Asian aesthetics

2) Design and illustrate the koi design in Adobe Illustrator

3) Print the koi design with a laser cutter in the Brown Design Workshop

4) Use the bandsaw to cut down the lengths of wooden dowels

5) Drill holes for the screws and bolts, using hand drills as well as drill presses, adjusting the sizes of the drill bits as necessary

6) Operated a circular saw to cut down the size of the base board

7) Screw together all components

8) Wire LEDs with a breadboard and batteries, which are placed inside the koi lantern
