# Koi Fish Lantern

The koi fish lantern was my first project in which I incorporated engineering in an art class (Sculpture: Conceptual Propositions). This project was open-ended, with the only specification being to design and build a lantern using a combination of woodworking and metalworking techniques.




## Deliverables

1) Design a height-adjustable lantern.

2) Confirm that the beam elements would not buckle under weight.
