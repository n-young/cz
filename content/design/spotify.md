# Spotify Wrapped

The design for “Spotify Wrapped” pulls inspiration from retro record shops.

## Description:

The prompt for this project was to create a map of sorts. I chose to map my music taste journey since it has changed drastically over the years, from EDM to K-pop to R&B to psychedelic pop. Below each year label is the album that I associate with that year, whether it’s because I listened to it the most or because it marked a pivot in my music taste.
