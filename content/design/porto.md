# Porto

The idea behind Porto is inspired by my father’s glass tea infuser, which is portable, double-walled, and minimalist. The double-walled glass insulates the tea -- but more importantly, it protects his hands from getting burned. Porto uses the same idea.



## Problem

1) Lightbulbs’ glass surfaces are too hot to touch with bare hands.

2) A strong but diffused light source is needed in a specific location, but lamps are not conveniently portable due to their size and weight.

## Solution

Porto’s final design has the following **features**:

1) Battery cover for light power source

2) Handle for portability

3) Outer layer of glass to protect from bulb heat

4) Inner layer of frosted glass containing light bulb

5) Unscrewable bottom to replace bulb
