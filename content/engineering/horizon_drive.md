# Horizon Drive

This project is under the USC Space Engineering Research Center (SERC). The purpose of this research project is to create a propellantless propulsion system using the theory of quantized inertia. I worked on designing and manufacturing the Horizon Drive cavity, which is made up of the bowl and the spikes.

## Problem

1) Consumable fuel (liquid, solid, nuclear) is necessary for satellite launch.
2) Large amount of propellant results in heavier vehicles (higher mission costs).


## Process

1) Research quantized inertia theory, Unruh waves, Rindler horizon, and the Casimir effect
2) Research electroplating cavity with silver as well as weight reduction of underlying cavity material
3) Recreate prior researcherâ€™s design in SolidWorks
4) Modify prior design to be CNC manufacturable: rounded edges, separated bowl and spikes, added flanges, changed spikes to be at 90 degree angle instead of concave upwards
5) Generate STL file to be printed with MakerBot 3D printer for cost reduction (for cavity to be made of ABS plastic, coated in silver)
6) Generate CNC toolpaths in NX and SolidWorks (for cavity to be made of aluminum, coated in silver)
7) Operate CNC machine to manufacture test pieces
8) Communicate with local plating services to silver-coat test pieces
