# Miscellaneous CAD


## CADing a Car: Lamborghini Aventador

I've always wondered how cars are 3D modeled -- the complex and curvilinear surfaces were a mystery to me. During Summer 2021, I decided to finally jump in and learn how to CAD a car.

I began by finding blueprints of the top, side, front, and back views of the Lamborghini Aventador.

I then laid them out on planes.

After that, I started making boundary surfaces to model the shapes of each face, constantly switching between the front, back, side, and top views to match the edges of my surfaces to the blueprints.

By the end, I had exactly 100 boundary surfaces and over 200 sketches (each boundary surface is made up of 2-3 sketches).

When I finished all the surfaces, I then used the PhotoView 360 SolidWorks add-in to render my car. Here are the final renders!

## ENGN1740: Computer Aided Visualization and Design Projects

In my ENGN1740: Computer Aided Visualization and Design class at Brown University, our projects asked us to choose objects of varying complexity to model in SolidWorks and dimension in drawings that adhere to ASME Y14.5 2009 standards.


I decided to model the following objects:

- Mousetrap (assembly)

- USB-C Adapter (part)

- Clothespin (part)

- Ruler (part)

### SolidWorks Models

### Modal Analysis

I performed modal analysis of the plastic cheese mousetrap component in Fusion 360. There are pin constraints in the connector area, a downward force from the bait on the triangular platform, and a point load from the trigger wire.

### SolidWorks Drawings

For the mousetrap assembly, I made drawings of several mousetrap part components following ASME Y14.5 2009 standards.

### Final Render

I rendered a couple of the CAD projects in Adobe Dimension, for fun!
