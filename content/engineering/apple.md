# Apple Design Test

The Apple Design Test is a test administered to Apple applicants year after year. Here's my take on it!

## Problem Statement

People have complained that the iPod doesn't have replaceable batteries. For your design project, we would like you to create a battery door mechanism, which will include a door, release button and door latching features to house and cover 2 AA batteries. The button should reside within the mechanical outline of the battery door.

The door should unlock when a user presses a button, which causes the door to pop open in the opposite direction. Please come up with 2
different mechanisms for this door.

Note carefully the mechanism requirement: a downward force on the button, normal to the door, should activate the button.
