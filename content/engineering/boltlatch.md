# Overview of Boeing Internship

For Summer 2022, I interned at Boeing as a Mechanical Design Engineer in the Payloads Concept Center. I worked on a variety of mechanical design projects, including a persons-of-reduced-mobility lavatory, an emergency exit aisle life vest deployment mechanism, a high lift actuator tolerance stack-up analysis, and an IMU-mounted portable platform assembly.
