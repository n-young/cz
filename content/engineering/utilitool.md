# Utilitool

In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, the need to limit viral contact and spread is more important than ever. One issue that poses a great risk to dispersing and contracting the virus is the publicâ€™s interaction with shared spaces, objects, and buttons, including but not limited to door handles, toilet handles, elevator buttons, and shopping carts.

This project aims to design and manufacture a universal tool, the UtiliTool, to interact with commonly-touched surfaces. The tool will go through multiple design iterations, be 3D modeled in SolidWorks, and, finally, 3D printed.
