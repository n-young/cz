# Bat Wing: Breuer Lab Research Solo Project

I'm currently a research assistant in the Breuer Lab at Brown University. The lab focuses on the fluid dynamics surrounding bat flight. My solo project initially involved repairing a broken mechanical bat wing shoulder mechanism, but now it's expanded to include attaching a personally-designed 3D-printed bat wing skeleton frame wrapped with membrane.

## Notes

I began by taking notes on the cam mechanism, such as which wires produced what motions. I also noted dimensions, parts, what I had done on each day.
