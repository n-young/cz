# No Face

In my free time, I wanted to build a simple animatronic, teaching myself the building process along the way. I chose to build a No Face robot to be powered by a Servo motor and an Arduino.

## Initial Planning

I began with character sketches to get a better idea of No Face's movements, character design, and overall demeanor.

Starting simple, I decided to model a nodding or bowing motion of the head.

## CAD Modeling: SolidWorks

Next, I modeled the parts and mechanisms I'd sketched in SolidWorks, making each component separately, then combining them in a final assembly.

## 3D Printing

I 3D-printed the ball-and-socket joint as well as No Face's mask. I then painted his face on.

More 3D-printing in progress!
