# ENGN1740: Computer Aided Visualization and Design Projects

In my ENGN1740: Computer Aided Visualization and Design class at Brown University, our projects ask us to choose objects of varying complexity to model in SolidWorks and dimension in drawings that adhere to ASME Y14.5 2009 standards.

I decided to model the following objects:

- Mousetrap (assembly)

- USB-C Adapter (part)

- Clothespin (part)

- Ruler (part)

## SolidWorks Models

## SolidWorks Drawings

For the mousetrap assembly, I made drawings of several mousetrap part components following ASME Y14.5 2009 standards.

## Final Render

I rendered a couple of the CAD projects in Adobe Dimension, for fun!
