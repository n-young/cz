# ENGN1740: Computer Aided Visualization and Design Projects

In my ENGN1740: Computer Aided Visualization and Design class at Brown University, our projects asked us to choose objects of varying complexity to model in SolidWorks and dimension in drawings that adhere to ASME Y14.5 2009 standards.

I decided to model the following objects:

- Mousetrap (assembly)

- USB-C Adapter (part)

- Clothespin (part)

- Ruler (part)

## SolidWorks Models

## Modal Analysis

I performed modal analysis of the plastic cheese mousetrap component in Fusion 360. There are pin constraints in the connector area, a downward force from the bait on the triangular platform, and a point load from the trigger wire.

## SolidWorks Drawings

For the mousetrap assembly, I made drawings of several mousetrap part components following ASME Y14.5 2009 standards.

## Final Render

I rendered a couple of the CAD projects in Adobe Dimension, for fun!
