# Ebb

Ebb is a sculpture combining sculpture, woodworking, and engineering. The mechanism behind Ebb is developed from a kinetic sculpture I made out of wood a few months prior (Flow). Ebb uses the same (but streamlined) cam mechanism to produce complex oscillating wave motions in its light projections.

# Flow

Flow is the kinetic sculpture that inspired Ebb. Flow is made using woodworking techniques, utilizing machines such as the bandsaw, drill press, and laser cutter. Putting a lightbulb at the center of the wooden base projects oscillating shadows onto the walls, creating an underwater ambience.
